                    <p>Every moment with you was a fleeting spark of happiness, it didnâ€™t last long, but itâ€™ll always have a place in my heart. Iâ€™ll always carry those memories with me. Maybe it was just bad timing, but it was real, and thatâ€™s what made it beautiful to me.</p>
                    <p>If someday you change your mind, Iâ€™ll still be here just find me. </p>
